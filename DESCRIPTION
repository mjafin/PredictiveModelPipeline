Description: This package allows to train high dimensional predictive and prognostic models. The following steps are implemented
1. Categorical (binary or multi class) classification, continuous regression and time-to-event analysis with censoring are supported. Each have their own performance evaluation measures.
2. Cross validation can be used to estimate generalisation performance; the expected performance should a model be trained on the full training data and applied to an external data set.
3. Multi sample pre-processing, filtering and feature selection are incorporated within cross validation and no information leakage is allowed.
4. Feature selection is performed via a wrapper approach (backwards elimination, forward selection) or an internal method (algorithm dependent).
5. The package uses a .yaml file for specifying the inference settings and a simple reference object style interface for the user.
